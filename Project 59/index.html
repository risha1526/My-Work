        <div class="line"> </div>
        <p> Dance is my  hobby and I enjoy dancing a lot. I started dancing when I was five years old and when I got older; my parents enrolled me in dance classes to pursue this passion.

I cannot go a day without dance, thatâ€™s how much I love dancing. I tried many dance forms but discovered that I am most comfortable in jazz. Thus, I am learning jazz from my dance teacher.



Dance became my passion from an early age. Listening to the beats of a dance number, I started to tap my feet and my parents recognized my talent for dance. Even when I am sad, I put on music to dance to vent out my feelings.

Thus, dance has been very therapeutic for me as well. In other words, it is not only an escape from the world but also a therapy for me.</p>

            <p>I love coding, dancing, gaming... But what do I get from all this? The answer is that I get hapiness and hapiness is all I worry about. </p> <div> <p>Video games have undeniably become an imperative part of most of our life, either as a form of entertainment and even hobby. Video games came into existence through the invention of the Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Device by Thomas T Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann in 1947. And in 1948 they got the patent for their invented device with knobs and buttons used for stimulating airborne enemies. It was not until the 1970s, and 1980s those video games reached the mainstream popularity.</p></div>
